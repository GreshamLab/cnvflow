workflow using CytoexploreR to analyze flow data from Cytek for CNV detection

Started Sept 21, 2021

The goal of this repo is to generate code for analyzing the long term experimental evolution experiments performed during the summer of 2021 that were analyzed using the Cytek flow cytometer.

The code uses the CytoexploreR and tidyverse packages.

For analysis of one to two flow datasets, see `vignette_SimpleFlow.nb.html` and `.Rmd`  
For flow data over a timecourse, see `vignette_TimecourseFlow.nb.html` and `.Rmd`  
See `workflow.R` for the most up-to-date edits to the code. Note that is the work-in-progress code and may be messy and subject to change. It builds on the script, `CytoExploreR_Cytek_code.R`  
The oldest version of the code is `CytoExploreR_Cytek_code.R`
