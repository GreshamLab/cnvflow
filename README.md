# cnvflow
workflow using CytoexploreR to analyze flow data from Cytek for CNV detection

Started Sept 21, 2021

The goal of this repo is to generate code for analyzing the long term experimental evolution experiments performed during the summer of 2021 that were analyzed using the Cytek flow cytometer.

The code uses the CytoexploreR and tidyverse packages.
